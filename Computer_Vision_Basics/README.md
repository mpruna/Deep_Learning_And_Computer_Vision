### Computer Vision fundamentals

Science that allows computers to understand images and video and 
determine what the computer "sees" or "recognizes‚Äù.

#### Computer Vision can be used for:
 - object clasification
 - object detection
 - object indentification
 - object restoration
 
### Where can we use computer vision:  
* Self Driving Cars 
* pedestrian/car detection
* Face recognition
* Object detection
* Handwriting Recognition
* License plate numbers detection
* Snapchat filters

One of the challenges in computer vision is the object classification. An object can be presented at a different angle, different lighting, different shape.
While is it's easier for humans to classify these objects we need to teach a computer to do the same.

### View point limitations

Example below shows an example where the view point can cause some problems. In the picture we see Toronto Tower but from a different angle.
We need to train the algorithm to recognize those images as instances of the same object.

### Camera resolution limitations

As the resolution gets better we can see an object in greater detail. Part of the challenge is to do image correction in a low resolution image

### Lighting limitations

It's hard to extract the object features when is dark.
